# Introduction to MetaboAnalyst

MetaboAnalystR comes with multiple vignetted ("tutorials") to illustrate how to perform distinct actions and processes.

The document [MetaboAnalystR Package](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/docs/RTutorial.xhtml) provides an *overview* to the distinct vignettes and links to each of them.

The current document is a short introduction to Enrichment Analysis as can be done by MetaboAnalyst. It uses the results of the comparisons performed in the Statiostical Analyses example.
