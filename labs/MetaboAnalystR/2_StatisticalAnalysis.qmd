# Introduction to MetaboAnalyst

MetaboAnalystR comes with multiple vignetted ("tutorials") to illustrate how to perform distinct actions and processes.

The document [MetaboAnalystR Package](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/docs/RTutorial.xhtml) provides an *overview* to the distinct vignettes and links to each of them.

The corrent document is a short introduction to some statistical analyses that can be done to derive"differential" metabolites, that  is those that show (significantly) distinct concebntrations between conditions.

This has been extracted from the tutorial [2.3. Statistical Analysis (one-factor)](https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/resources/vignettes/Statistical_Analysis_Module.html) which shows how to do it with higher detail.

## Data for the analyses

We use the Cachexia dataset that has benn previously preprocessed in the document "1. Introduction to MetaboAnalystR". The normalized `mSet`object has been saved to a binary file which is recovered here for further use.

```{r loadData}
rm(list=ls())
library(MetaboAnalystR)
load(file="preprocessed_Cachexia.Rda")
# show(mSet)
```

# Data Analysis

In this document we will mainly focus on the analyses that yield a list of differential compounds that can be later used for Enrichment Analyses.

However, in order to proceed "reasonably" we start with a multivariate exploration in order to detect if *there seem* to be differrences between the groups.

## PCA visualization

```{r doPCA}
# Perform PCA analysis
mSet<-PCA.Anal(mSet)

# Create a 2D PCA score plot
mSet<-PlotPCA2DScore(mSet, "pca_score2d_0_", format = "png", dpi=72, width=NA, pcx= 1, pcy=2, reg=0, show=1, grey.scale=0)

```

All these plots go to files that can be included or explored apart.


```{r showPCA, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pca_score2d_0_dpi72.png")
```

The second dimension seems to clearly separate the two groups, so we can expect to be able to find significant differences.


## Fold change Analysis

The goal of fold-change (FC) analysis is to compare the absolute value of change between two group means. Since column-wise normalization (i.e. log transformation, mean-centering) will significantly alter absolute values, FC is calculated as the ratio between two group means using the data before column-wise normalization was applied.

```{r foldChange}
# Perform fold-change analysis on uploaded data, unpaired
mSet<-FC.Anal(mSet, 2.0, 0, FALSE)

# Plot fold-change analysis
mSet<-PlotFC(mSet, "fc_0_", "png", 72, width=NA)

# To view fold-change 
mSet$analSet$fc$fc.log
```

```{r showFC, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("fc_0_dpi72.png")
```

# Significance (t-)tests

MetaboAnalystR supports various options for performing T-test analysis. Users can select the analysis type (paired), the group variance (equal.var), whether the test is parametric or non-parametric (nonpar), and the adjusted p-value (FDR) cut-off (threshp).

```{r ttest}
# Perform T-test (parametric)
mSet<-Ttests.Anal(mSet, nonpar=F, threshp=0.05, paired=FALSE, equal.var=TRUE, pvalType = "fdr", all_results=TRUE)
```

The results of the t-test can be viewed plotting the p-values by indexed or with respct to the fold change.

```{r plotIndex}
mSet<-PlotTT(mSet, imgName = "tt_0_", format = "png", dpi = 72, width=NA)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("tt_0_dpi72.png")
```

```{r volcano}
mSet<-Volcano.Anal(mSet, FALSE, 2.0, 0, F, 0.1, TRUE, "raw")
mSet<-PlotVolcano(mSet, "volcano_0_", 1, 0, format ="png", dpi=72, width=NA)

```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("volcano_0_dpi72.png")
```


## T-test results: Metabolites lists

The result of a comparison test is usually the base for enrichment analysis.

This result has been written in the `t_test_all.csv` or the `t_test.csv` files and can be recovered from there or from the `mSet`object.

In this case, where the number of features is small it can be shown as:

```{r}
sigMat <- mSet$analSet$tt$sig.mat
dim(sigMat)
head(sigMat)
```
